The e-mail in the *Screenshot from 2017-03-07 02-26-55* images sends you to the *Screenshot from 2017-03-07 02-27-19* image website, link: http://belleileenmer-location.com/libraries/phpmailer/Portal_Seguro/acesso/1_acessar.php?05,27-14,07,03-17,am#cod/acessar/conta/index.jsf

Before directing to that link, appears the link: http://www.tibetencostarica.com/modules/mod_menu/seguro.png/
I think the tibetencostarica domain/server is being used as an intermediary, maybe.

I tried to send a message to the tibetencostarica website, but their contact form does not work properly, and there is no other way of contact besides a telephone number.
