# viruse Planilhas Março

I've received the email in the screenshot image.

Cliking on it directly downloads the *Planilha_17_Março_001.zip* file that contains the *Planilha_17_Março_001.js*. The .js has a link to domain :https://1458555568.rsc.cdn77.org/ProcessPedefender.zip

And *the ProcessPedefender.zip* contains an .exe file that I did not have time to tinker.


Case sent to cdn77 twitter.
